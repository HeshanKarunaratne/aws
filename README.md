1.Hosting a Static Website on AWS with S3, CloudFront and Route53 | Web | Hosting | AWS
  
![Diagram](resources/images/services-1.PNG "Diagram")

- Below service will be used
    - S3: Upload website code
    - CloudFront: CDN to cache request
    - Route53: Act as a DNS to redirect request to Cloudfront
    - Certificate Manager: Apply the certificate to CloudFront so that it would support SSL
    
- Steps
    1. Get a domain. 
    2. Create a hosted zone in route53 and copy namespace values to domain nameservers.
    3. Create a S3 bucket with domain name and configure it as a static website hosting.
    4. Add a bucket policy so that it can be accessed.
        ~~~json
            {
              "Version":"2012-10-17",
              "Statement":[
                {
                  "Sid":"AddPerm",
                  "Effect":"Allow",
                  "Principal": "*",
                  "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
                  "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::{bucket_name}/*"]
                  }
              ]
            }
        ~~~
    5. Now you should be able to access the site from S3, but we need to cache our site through cloudfront
    6. Create a cloudfront distribution and under the origin domain name paste S3 website url without http://
    7. Update domain name as Alternate domain name in cloudfront.
    8. Acquire a certificate and apply to cloudfront(ACM).
    9. You need to apply the CNAME given by certificate manager to route53
    10. You need to configure route53 to cloudfront using an A record with alias target to cloudfront domain name.

2.Deploying React, Angular, Vue.js apps on AWS

Check angular version
- ng version

Create new angular project
- ng new angularApp --style=scss --routing

- Steps
    1. Create a user that has permission to upload build files to S3.
        - Navigate to IAM
        - Create a new user with Programmatic access(AWS API,CLI,SDK access) and Management console access
        - Best practice to give only the access that the user needs rather than giving all the access(List access, GetObject and PutObject access)
        - You need to download Access key Id, Secret Access Key and Password for that user
    2. Configure AWS Cli in machine and Cli with created user
        - aws configure --profile {name}
    3. Write a simple script to deploy to S3
        ~~~json
           {
             "deploy-s3" : "aws s3 --profile {name} sync ./dist/ s3://{bucket-name} --region us-east-1"
           }   
        ~~~
    4. Invalidating CloudFront cache 
        ~~~json
           {
             "cache-bust" : "aws cloudfront --profile {name} create-invalidation --distribution-id {dist-id} --paths '/*'"
           }   
        ~~~
    5. Make sure to add permission for the above user to interact with cloudfront as well
 
3.Developing an API backend - AWS Lambda - API Gateway - DynamoDB

![Diagram](resources/images/services-2.PNG "Diagram")
    
Serverless Framework
- npm install -g serverless
- serverless -v

Create a new service
- serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-service

~~~yml
service: my-service
provider:
    name: aws
    runtime: nodejs6.10
    profile: {username}
functions:
    hello:
        handler: handler.hello
        events:
            - http:
                path: users/hello
                method: get
~~~
   
Deploy a serverless app
- serverless deploy -v
    
Remove Serverless stack and everything provisioned
- serverless remove

- steps
    1. Need to create another path pattern that directs apis to API-Gateway
        - Navigate to cloudfront(copy api-gateway url)
        - Create another origin
            - domain as api-gateway url
        - Create another behaviour with path pattern as '/dev/*'
